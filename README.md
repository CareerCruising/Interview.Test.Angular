A junior developer has just accomplished a task suspicously fast...and went for lunch.
There are now unit tests breaking on the build server and only you have the skills to fix it.

You should 

  - Fix the broken unit test
  - Make sure there is adequate test coverage.
  - Make sure all code is clean and follows best practices 

All joking aside, there is no need to finish this in the span of a lunch hour. 

The test is so you can show us what clean code looks like. Clean it up as best you can!

You will be joining a team that believes in S.O.L.I.D.D principles. We favour declaritive over imperative programming.

Submissions that follow these principles will be favored since you will fit right in with the current team. If there is a part of the test that blocks you from completing it, then put some comments explaining why it was blocking, and what you would have done if the obstacle was removed.

Good Luck!
